thread-safe modelview matrix

tri-fans same as convex polygon?

add check, set error_code

double or float???

3.13
flood fill optimize parrelell? with bresenham boudary
render boundary to frame buffer and aux bit buffer, then flood fill to frame buffer

Parallel algorithm: process each scan line in 
one processor. Each scan line is independent


remove redundant headers, like stdio.h
merge cpp, use inline

3.19
interp between span int(left),int(right), scan between int(ymin),int(ymax) might cause the texture bilinear filter bug
use float instead, dx, dy

texture border. for GL_CLAMP on edge

depth mask, color mask

bitset bug

3.18
texture on back side always has an edge??
smooth bug(must triangulation)
clamp col_front_pri early

3.17
blending per fragment + fog
stencil

aa

select feedback
pixel,bitmap
display list
array, buffer

3.16
top-left?? box edge
z-buffer how to 32bit....

3.15
// is it linear in clip space?? lerp attribs
dont do repeated  calc, like translate fcolor to 255color first

cube top face color smooth ,wrong, flash


line clipping bug
strips and loops, and polygons
spheres

clipping behind camera problem?? boudary width 480 (0,479), in glViewport

//culling,
// zbuffer depth test
alpha blend, texture

scanline exceptions
mipmaping

3.14

some macro expand, eval too many time? efficiency, like CLAMP_MIN_MAX

clipspace 0,0,0 1,1,1 more efficient?

lighting, 


anti alias (line, with width, point)
